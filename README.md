# special-counter

This a algorithm made with [python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and is for count. I know this is ridiculous, but it not only counts in a system if not in any. It use a recursive algorithm for do this possible. As well you can use for calculate all combinations with the list of symbols and the number of digits, that is the original idea.

For use it, you need **python 3.9.2** or higher and the base libraries.

*Play with it and go crazy*
